        <h1>About our Project</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p id="purposeOne">Air quality affects our daily lives, even when we are unaware of it. This project is
                intended to raise awareness
                of air quality issues and promote our users to make informed decisions about their outdoor activities,
                health,
                and overall lifestyle. Staying informed about air quality is both convenience but also safety. Unsafe
                conditions
                can lead to various health conditions, like respiratory issues.</p>
            <p id="purposeTwo">This web application will allow users to input their geographic location such as their
                city, state or zip code
                using data from reliable APIs to deliver accurate and up-to-date air quality information for a
                particular area.
                The data will be presented using an interactive map, as well as using charts as a visualization showing
                pollutant levels. Our system will also help display tips for health safety based on the air quality
                index.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>APIs</h2>
            <p>This is the list of APIs that our application uses</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IQ Air
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provides access to real-time air quality data for different locations around the world. IQ
                            Air also
                            gives coordinates to help make a visual map.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Leaflet JS
                    <ul>
                        <li>Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
                            This
                            will be used to create an interactive map that updates with the user's zip code.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>ZipCodeAPI
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is the API used to convert zipcode information entered by the user to city and state
                            data.</li>
                    </ul>

        <h2>Air Quality - Good or Bad?</h2>
        <p>Air quality is separated into categories, commonly referred to as the Air Quality Index. The following is an
            explanation of the different AQ levels based on the chart:</p>
        <section class="flex">

            <ol>
                <li>Good:
                    <ul>
                        <li>This air quality level is indicated by the green section, which ranges from 0 to 50. Air
                            quality in
                            this range is considered healthy for everyone.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Moderate:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The yellow section, ranging from 51 to 100, indicates moderate air quality. At this level,
                            air
                            pollution may be a concern for some sensitive groups, such as people with respiratory
                            conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The orange section, ranging from 101 to 150, indicates that the air quality
                            is unhealthy for sensitive groups, such as children, older adults, and people with certain
                            health
                            conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Unhealthy:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The red section, ranging from 151 to 200, indicates that the air quality is unhealthy for
                            everyone, not just sensitive groups. At this level, everyone may experience health effects.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Very Unhealthy:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The purple section, ranging from 201 to 300, indicates that the air quality is very
                            unhealthy, and everyone may experience more serious health effects.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Hazardous:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The maroon section, ranging from 301 to 500, indicates that the air quality is hazardous,
                            and
                            everyone may experience severe health effects.</li>
