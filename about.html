    <h1>About our Project</h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p> Air quality affects our daily lives, even when we are unaware of it. This project is intended to raise awareness
        of air quality issues and promote our users to make informed decisions about their outdoor activities, health,
        and overall lifestyle. Staying informed about air quality is both convenience but also safety. Unsafe conditions
        can lead to various health conditions, like respiratory issues. </p>
    <p>Our application </p>
    <p>This web application will allow users to input their geographic location such as their city, state or zip code
        using data from reliable APIs to deliver accurate and up-to-date air quality information for a particular area.
        The data will be presented using an interactive map, as well as using charts as a visualization showing
        pollutant levels. Our system will also help display tips for health safety based on the air quality index.</p>
