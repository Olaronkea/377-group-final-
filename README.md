YourAQ

Project Description:

Our web application will allow users to input their geographic location such as their city, state or zip code and with that be able to see real time air quality data for that particular area. The data will be presented using an interactive map, as well as using charts as a visualization showing pollutant levels. Our system will also help display tips for health safety based on the air quality index.

This project will be most compatible with Windows browsers, however, other desktop browser will most likely work as well.
